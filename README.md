# Reinforcement Learning Project: Maze and Mountain Car Problems

## Introduction

This project explores the fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through two classic environments: mazes and the Mountain Car problem. It delves into core RL concepts and implements various algorithms to train agents to navigate these environments effectively.

##Covered Topics

**Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):** Understanding the framework for modeling sequential decision-making problems in RL.

**Dynamic Programming:** Exploring optimal policy and value function estimation techniques.

**Value Iteration Algorithm:** Implementing a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal value function.

**On-Policy vs. Off-Policy Learning:** Distinguishing between learning from executed policies (on-policy) and generalizing beyond them (off-policy).

**Q-Learning and SARSA Algorithms:** Two prominent model-free RL algorithms for learning the optimal policy.

**SARSA(Î») Algorithm:** Incorporating eligibility traces into SARSA for improved learning efficiency.

**Hyperparameter Study and Fine-Tuning:** Optimizing RL algorithms by adjusting hyperparameters for better performance.
